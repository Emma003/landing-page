# landing-page
Took about 8hrs split in two days. 

Struggled a bit with fitting the big image into 50% of its container. Not much responsive design for now, it looks good on 800*600 screens. The little square images become rectangular when you expand the page which isn't really desired. 

Learned: matching margin & padding values to get even dimensions. Treat the image and its direct container like two different items!!!
